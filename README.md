# CartoonGAN

##### Python version

```python = 3.8```

## Data

Here we explain how to get/extract the required data.
### Cartoons

Cartoons can be extracted from movies in the

### Pictures


## Demonstrator

### Rank cartoons

We developed a tab in the demonstrator to evaluate the results of the cartoonizer. Thanks to this tab, you'll be able to rank the different predictions to estimate which method giuves the best results.
Cartoonized images must be placed in the `data/results/<model_id>` where `<model_id>` is the folder containing all cartonnized images. All predicted images must have the same name as the original image. For example, for the test image `667626_18933d713e.jpg` in flickr dataset should have the same name in the `data\results\model_1` folder.
